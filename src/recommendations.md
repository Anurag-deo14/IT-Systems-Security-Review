## Recommendations for Security Improvements

1. **Password Policy**:
   - Enforce a password policy that requires:
     - Minimum 8 characters
     - At least one uppercase letter
     - At least one number
     - At least one special character

2. **Implement HTTPS**:
   - Configure the web server to use HTTPS by obtaining an SSL certificate.
   - This ensures that all data between users and the server is encrypted.

3. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Use middleware (e.g., `express-rate-limit` for Node.js) to limit the number of login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
   - Suggested configuration: Max 5 login attempts within 15 minutes.

4. **Regular Security Audits**:
   - Perform regular security audits to ensure compliance with security best practices.
