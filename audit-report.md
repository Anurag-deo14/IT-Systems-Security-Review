# IT Systems Security Audit Report

## Overview
This document outlines the results of an in-depth security audit of the mock IT system, focusing on vulnerabilities in information security controls and network security infrastructure.

## Identified Vulnerabilities
1. **Weak Passwords**: The admin panel uses a weak password (e.g., '1234'), which can easily be guessed by attackers.
2. **Lack of HTTPS**: The web application communicates over HTTP, which makes it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
3. **No Rate Limiting**: The login endpoint is vulnerable to brute-force attacks due to the absence of rate limiting.

## Recommendations
- Enforce a strong password policy.
- Implement HTTPS to secure communications.
- Use rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Conclusion
The audit has identified several security weaknesses that could expose the system to attacks. Implementing the recommended security improvements will mitigate these risks and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the system.
